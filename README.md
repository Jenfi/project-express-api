# Express API Project

This project incldues a set up of routes and endpoints for handling a chosen api from a json file. The json file is an api of listed movies and tv-shows from Netflix. 

I have set up the following endpoints:

- /shows
- /shows/:id
- /movies
- /moives/:id
- /year/:year

## The problem

After deciding which API to use I started analysing the API and identifying what kind of endpoints would make sense and could be desirable for a user. Once decided on this, I got to work with the code after reading up on express and routes.

Once ready with the priject I deployed it at heroku.

If I had more time I would have made queries.
